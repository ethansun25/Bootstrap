# HTML

I put increased attention to design and the layout. Previously, I had the general schedule listed out in bullet points, but I found it much cleaner in a table. I also centered the image, fixed the link colors, and chose a consistent color throughout. 

# Bootstrap

Flexible elements:
1. Alerts (for links)
2. Cards (in grid)
3. Badges (in enrichment activites)
4. List groups (enrich. activities)
5. Dropdowns (in nav-bar and class schedule)
6. Tables w/ striped rows

Open elements:
1. Offcanvas (for google apps)
2. Shadows (in grid)
